    <p>
        You are now in line to be assigned to a group for the rest of the experiment. <br>
        In order to stay in line, you'll need to prevent the orange bar from ending by clicking on the mouse/keyboard.<br>
        Once there would be enough active players available you'll move to the rest of the experiment.<br>
        <br>
        If you'll let the orange bar end you'll be removed from the line. <br>
        You'll be able to rejoin the line by restarting the orange bar (by clicking on the mouse/keyboard).<br>
        <br>
        If you'll not be assigned to a group soon you'll be passed to the end page and you'll get payment/bonus according to your activeness while waiting.
